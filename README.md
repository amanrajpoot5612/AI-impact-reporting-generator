AI Impact Reporting Generator (Module 3)

An AI-powered sustainability impact reporting system that calculates and presents real-time environmental impact metrics for products, such as plastic saved, carbon emissions avoided, and sourcing impact.

This module is designed as a standalone system, separate from Module 1, and can be integrated into e-commerce, ESG dashboards, or sustainability reporting platforms.

🚀 Features

📊 Real-time sustainability impact calculation

♻️ Plastic waste reduction estimation

🌍 Carbon emission avoidance metrics

📍 Local vs standard sourcing insights

🧠 AI-style logic layer (service-based architecture)

🎨 Clean, user-friendly web dashboard

🗄️ Database-driven (MySQL)
